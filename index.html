            <h1>What Is Ruby Manor?</h1>
            <p>Ruby Manor is two things. The first, and most obvious, is <a href="#when">the series of conferences</a> held in London focussing on the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby programming language</a>. The second is <a href="#manifesto">our manifesto</a> for how we believe conferences could be run.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="when">
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The first in the series, originally just &ldquo;Ruby Manor&rdquo; but now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity">retconned</a> as &ldquo;<a href="http://rubymanor.org/classic/">Ruby Manor Classic</a>&rdquo; to avoid confusion with the series, happened in 2008. We gathered together 120 rubyists from London, the rest of the UK, and mainland Europe for a day of 10 talks about their favourite language. All this for only &pound;12!</p>
            <p>We followed this in 2009 with &ldquo;<a href="http://rubymanor.org/harder/">Ruby Manor 2: Manor Harder</a>&rdquo;. This time it was a slightly smaller affair with just over 100 attendees paying &pound;8 each. Not everything was smaller though, as we managed to fit in 12 talks.</p>
            <p>The conference took a break in 2010 while we worked out what we could do better next time around. In 2011 we returned with our third installment, &ldquo;<a href="http://rubymanor.org/3/">Ru3y Manor</a>&rdquo;. For &pound;14 per attendee we filled a lecture theatre with 150 attendees and 8 talks.</p>
            <p>We are currently planning the fourth in the series and aim to run it in Spring 2013.</p>

          <section id="manifesto">
            <h1>Manifesto</h1>
            <p>The Ruby Manor conferences are an attempt to explore solutions to two main conference problems that we had experienced time and time again in the past: value for money and relevancy of content.</p>
            <p>Conferences often suffer from content fatigue: the same Famous Person keynote speakers delivering the same content around the conference circuit; war stories that are rarely applicable to your situation; talks with a snappy title but which fall flat in content; and presentations from sponsors which are... well, rarely good.</span></p>
            <p>Does a conference need to cost hundreds of pounds or dollars? Maybe you think a conference needs all of the pomp and bloat you might be used to: plush convention centres, flying in big names, the (often disappointing) lunch-boxes, t-shirts and other swag for everyone. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;hallway track&rdquo; that people enjoy the most at conferences, so why are they so expensive?</p>
            <p>Instead, we wanted to try to deliver a vibrant conference experience with an affordable ticket price, with a focus on quality content and lots of opportunities to meet like-minded people who are excited about Ruby.</p>
            <p>We want to redefine what &ldquo;conference&rdquo; means, and show the developer community that they can have great conference experiences without the ceremony, t-shirts and swag.</p>
            <p>We have tried with each Ruby Manor to involve the community directly. To this end we only act as organisers and never as curators. Our CFP process is held in the open and we encourage the community to interact directly with those proposing talks to help focus their proposal on what the community would find most relevant. Final selection of talks is then made by community vote, with the most popular talks being chosen</p>
            <p>The details of this process change over time, but it is key to our manifesto goal of relevancy of content. Originally it was run by hand via our <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/ruby-manor">mailing list</a>, but for Ru3y Manor we premiered a webapp, <a href="http://vestibule.rubymanor.org/">Vestibule</a>, to provide more structure and publicise the community involvement more. We plan to improve Vestibule for future Ruby Manor installments.</p>
            <p>Ruby Manor something something transparent costings something something.</p>
