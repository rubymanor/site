            <h1>What Is Ruby Manor?</h1>
            <p>Ruby Manor is two things. &nbsp;The first, and most obvious, 
              is <a href="#when">the series of conferences</a> held
               in London focussing on the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby
                  programming language</a>. &nbsp;The second is 
                  <a href="#manifesto">our manifesto</a> for how we 
                  believe conferences could be run.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="when">
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The first in the series, originally just &ldquo;Ruby 
              Manor&rdquo; but now 
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity">retconned</a>
              as &ldquo;<a href="http://rubymanor.org/classic/">Ruby Manor 
              Classic</a>&rdquo; to avoid confusion with the series, happened 
              in 2008. &nbsp;We gathered together 120 rubyists from London,
              the rest of the UK, and mainland Europe for a day of 10 talks 
              about their favourite language. &nbsp;All this for only &pound;12!</p>
            <p>We followed this in 2009 with 
              &ldquo;<a href="http://rubymanor.org/harder/">Ruby Manor 2:
              Manor Harder</a>&rdquo;. &nbsp;This time it was a slightly 
              smaller affair with just over 100 attendees paying &pound;8
              each. &nbsp;Not everything was smaller though, as we managed to 
              fit in 12 talks.</p>
            <p>The conference took a break in 2010 while we worked out what we
              could do better next time around. &nbsp;In 2011 we returned with
              our third installment, 
              &ldquo;<a href="http://rubymanor.org/3/">Ru3y Manor</a>&rdquo;. 
              &nbsp;For &pound;14 per attendee we filled a lecture theatre 
              with 150 attendees and 8 talks.</p>
            <p>We are currently planning the fourth in the series and aim to 
              run it in Spring 2013.</p>

          <section id="manifesto">
            <h1>Manifesto</h1>
            <p>The Ruby Manor conferences are an attempt to explore 
              solutions to two main conference problems that we had 
              experienced time and time again in the past: value for money
              and relevancy of content.</p>
            <p>Conferences often suffer from content fatigue: the same 
              Famous Person keynote speakers delivering the same content 
              around the conference circuit; war stories that are rarely 
              applicable to your situation; talks with a snappy title but 
              which fall flat in content; and presentations from sponsors 
              which are... well, rarely good.</span></p>
            <p>Does a conference need to cost hundreds of pounds or 
              dollars? Maybe you think a conference needs all of the pomp 
              and bloat you might be used to: plush convention centres, 
              flying in big names, the (often disappointing) lunch-boxes, 
              t-shirts and other swag for everyone. It&rsquo;s the 
              &ldquo;hallway track&rdquo; that people enjoy the most at 
              conferences, so why are they so expensive?</p>
            <p>Instead, we wanted to try to deliver a vibrant conference 
              experience with an affordable ticket price, with a focus on
              quality content and lots of opportunities to meet 
              like-minded people who are excited about Ruby.</p>
            <p>We want to redefine what &ldquo;conference&rdquo; means, 
              and show the developer community that they can have great 
              conference experiences without the ceremony, t-shirts and 
              swag.</p>
            <p>We have tried with each Ruby Manor to involve the community
              directly. &nbsp;To this end we only act as organisers and 
              never as curators. &nbsp;Our CFP process is held in the open
              and we encourage the community to interact directly with 
              those proposing talks to help focus their proposal on what
              the community would find most relevant. &nbsp;Final
              selection of talks is then made by community vote, with the 
              most popular talks being chosen</p>
            <p>The details of this process change over time, but it is key
              to our manifesto goal of relevancy of content. 
              &nbsp;Originally it was run by hand via our 
              <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/ruby-manor">mailing
              list</a>, but for Ru3y Manor we premiered a webapp, 
              <a href="http://vestibule.rubymanor.org/">Vestibule</a>, to 
              provide more structure and publicise the community 
              involvement more. &nbsp;We plan to improve Vestibule for 
              future Ruby Manor installments.</p>
            <p>Ruby Manor something something transparent costings 
              something something.</p>
